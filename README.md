This repository serves as a home for the code our team used for our BME 260 PBL #1 project to mathematically model 
vitamin D and its derivatives and calcium throughout the body. The effects of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on this body
can also be observed using this model. 

This repository contains two files:
  **VD_main_eq.py**: Consists of governing equations and performs calculations including molar conversions, calcidiol production rate, 
  calcitriol production rate, and calcium absorption rate. Uses these rates to produce Figures 2, 3, and  4.
  **longterm_bone.py**: Generates Figure 5 for comparing the calcium storage in the bones of a healthy individual versus the calcium 
  storage in the bones of an individual with CKD over time. 

Please refer to our original written report for a list of assumptions and equation explanations corresponding to this model.
